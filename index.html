          I thrive when I got the chance to combine my recently gained knowledge
          in state of the art software engineering and hardware applications.
          Some call it IoT, I want to show the benefits in a fully connected
          environment.

            <h4>Automotive</h4>
            I'm a proud co-owner of a VW Bus T3 from 1988. I travel Europe with
            my partner and for that I have to use my gained knowledge from my
            apprenticeship.
            <h4>Self driving car</h4>
            Besides loving to drive by myself I see the real value for the
            society within self driving cars. I look forward to see Elon Masks
            promise fullfilled, when he announced full self driving capability
            end of 2019. Therefore I myself try to protoype some systems. Such

            In general every Hardware Bit has his place and I love to get to the
            Bits. Sometimes this includes applying network sniffing techniques
            to Serial Bus systems (ex.

          I am a public speaker and teacher and is always open for pitches to
          speak at events, schools, and Meetups. I am also terrible at answering
          email and has a current unanswered email. Got a speaking gig,
          question, an idea, a comment, a request? The best way to get in touch
