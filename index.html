            I'm a proud co-owner of a VW Bus T3 from 1988. I travel Europe with
            my partner and for that I have to use my gained knowledge from my
            apprenticeship.
            <h4>Self driving car</h4>
            Besides loving to drive by myself I see the real value for the
            society within self driving cars. I look forward to see Elon Masks
            promise fullfilled, when he announced full self driving capability
            end of 2019. Therefore I myself try to protoype some systems. Such
            as the

            or enabling a toy car with simple following the street.
            <h4>Hardware</h4>
            In general every Hardware Bit has his place and I love to get to the
            Bits. Sometimes this includes applying network sniffing techniques
            to Serial Bus systems (ex.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface"

          I am a public speaker and teacher and is always open for pitches to
          speak at events, schools, and Meetups. I am also terrible at answering
          email and has a current unanswered email. Got a speaking gig,
          question, an idea, a comment, a request? The best way to get in touch
          with me is through

            >LinkedIn</a

          where I usually respond faster.
